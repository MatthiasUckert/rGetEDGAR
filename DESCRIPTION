Description: Provides tools for downloading and processing SEC EDGAR (Electronic Data 
    Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) filings with a focus on performance and reliability. 
    The package implements a complete pipeline for accessing financial regulatory documents,
    including master indices retrieval, document link extraction, file downloading, and text
    parsing. Features include parallel processing to optimize download times, rate-limited
    requests that strictly adhere to SEC guidelines (10 requests/second), robust error
    handling with detailed logging, and efficient storage in both SQLite and Parquet formats.
    Supports incremental updates to avoid redundant downloads, offers comprehensive filtering
    options for targeting specific companies, document types, and time periods, and includes
    utilities for standardizing and processing filing text content.
