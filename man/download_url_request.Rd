\description{
Downloads a document from a specified URL and saves it to the filesystem.
This function handles different content types appropriately based on file extension.
}
\details{
The function determines the appropriate download method based on the file extension:
\itemize{
\item Text-based formats (html, htm, xml, xsd, txt) are downloaded as text
\item Other formats (like PDF, ZIP) are downloaded as binary data
}

The function creates the necessary directory structure if it doesn't exist.
If the target file already exists, the function returns silently without
re-downloading to avoid duplicate work.

Error handling is implemented to log issues with HTTP requests or content
parsing while allowing the process to continue with other documents.
