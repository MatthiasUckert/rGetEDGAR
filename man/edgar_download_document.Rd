\usage{
edgar_download_document(
  .dir,
  .user,
  .doc_ids,
  .keep_orig = TRUE,
  .workers = 1L,
  .verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.dir}{Character string. Path to the base directory where all downloaded data (original and parsed)
will be stored. Must contain the expected subdirectory structure (as returned by \code{get_directories()}).}

\item{.user}{Character string.
The \emph{User-Agent} (typically an email address) to send in HTTP
requests to the SEC EDGAR servers, to comply with the SECâ€™s fair access policy.}

\item{.doc_ids}{Character vector.
A vector of \code{DocID} identifiers corresponding to filings in the SEC EDGAR database.
Only those documents whose parsed version does not already exist (in the \code{Parsed} folder) will be fetched.}

\item{.keep_orig}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, the function will compress the downloaded original
files for each \code{TypeSave}/\code{YQSave} grouping into a ZIP archive at the end of processing.
If \code{FALSE}, original files are deleted after parsing.}

\item{.workers}{Integer (default \code{1L}). The number of parallel workers to use when parsing documents.
Passed to \code{\link[future]{plan}("multisession", workers = ...)}. Setting this to
greater than 1 will parse multiple files concurrently.}

\item{.verbose}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, progress messages (e.g., download rates,
messages per file) will be printed to the console. If \code{FALSE}, all internal messages
are suppressed.}
}
\value{
Called for side effects: original files are downloaded
}
\description{
Downloads and processes documents from the SEC EDGAR system based on a set of document IDs.
This function orchestrates the download of original filings and the creation of parsed versions
for downstream analysis. Downloads are performed in parallel using a configurable number
of workers. Original files can optionally be retained and compressed into ZIP archives.
