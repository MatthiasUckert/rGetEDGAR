\description{
Prepares a list of SEC EDGAR documents to download based on provided document IDs.
This function filters the document links database to identify which documents need
to be downloaded and determines appropriate file paths for saving.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Queries the document links dataset to find matching document IDs
\item Joins with document type mapping table to standardize document types
\item Creates file paths for both original and parsed document storage
\item Filters out documents that have already been processed
}

Document types are standardized according to a predefined mapping table,
and output paths are generated using a consistent directory structure organized
by document type and year-quarter period.
